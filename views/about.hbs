    <h3>Project Title: Collaborative Code Editor with Real-Time Communication Features</h3>
    <p>
        Description:

        The Collaborative Code Editor is a feature-rich platform designed to enhance the collaborative coding experience
        among friends or team members. The platform integrates a powerful code editor with real-time communication
        tools, including live chat and video conferencing. This project aims to provide a seamless and interactive
        environment for users to collaborate on coding projects, discuss ideas, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

        Key Features:

        Code Editing:

        The platform offers a versatile and user-friendly code editor that supports multiple programming languages.
        Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other essential features are integrated to enhance the coding
        experience.
        Real-Time Collaboration:

        Users can collaborate on coding projects simultaneously, enabling multiple individuals to work on the same
        codebase in real-time.
        Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for others, fostering a collaborative and synchronized coding
        environment.
        Live Chat:

        The integrated live chat feature allows users to communicate with each other while working on the code.
        Users can exchange messages, share code snippets, and discuss project-related matters in a dedicated chat
        window.
        Live Video Conferencing:

        The platform includes live video conferencing capabilities, enabling face-to-face communication among
        collaborators.
        Users can initiate video calls within the code editor environment, facilitating more interactive discussions and
        problem-solving.
        User Authentication:

        To ensure security and privacy, the platform incorporates a robust user authentication system.
        Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles to maintain a personalized experience.
        Version Control Integration:

        Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) allows users to manage changes, track revisions, and
        collaborate more effectively on larger codebases.
        File Sharing:

        The platform supports seamless file sharing, enabling users to easily exchange code files, documents, and other
        project-related resources.
        Notification System:

        A notification system alerts users about changes made by collaborators, new chat messages, and upcoming video
        calls, ensuring everyone stays informed.
        This Collaborative Code Editor with Real-Time Communication aims to redefine the way developers and teams work
        together on coding projects, fostering a collaborative and efficient coding environment with a focus on
        real-time interaction and communication.
